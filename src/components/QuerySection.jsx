    question: "Are the laws the same for all Pakistani nationals?",
    answer: `Yes, they are. But many people don’t know what these laws actually mean for them. 
For example: If someone is a foreign national and marries a person whose age is below Pakistan’s legal minimum, even if it’s acceptable in their country, that marriage won’t be accepted or registered in Pakistan and they won’t be able to bring their spouse here.`
